# Literals

This project demonstrates the use of various data types in Swift, including URLs, integers, binary numbers, octal numbers, hexadecimal numbers, floats, booleans, and characters. Below are the variable definitions used in this example:

```
# Variable Definitions
# Site URL

let siteURL = "https:www.apple.com"
This variable stores a URL as a string.

# Integer

let num: Int = 25
This variable stores an integer value of 25.

# Binary Number

let binary = 0b101
This variable stores a binary number. The value 0b101 represents the decimal number 5.

# Octal Number

let octal = 0o13
This variable stores an octal number. The value 0o13 represents the decimal number 11.

# Hexadecimal Number

let hexa = 0x13
This variable stores a hexadecimal number. The value 0x13 represents the decimal number 19.

# Float

let pi: Float = 3.14
This variable stores a floating-point number representing the mathematical constant pi.

# Boolean

let isFan: Bool = true
This variable stores a boolean value, indicating whether something is true (true) or false (false).

# Character

let char: Character = "P"
This variable stores a single character.

# Usage
These variable definitions can be used in a Swift program to demonstrate how to work with different data types. The code above can be copied and used in any Swift project to see these variable definitions in action.
